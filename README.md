# Instructions for Running Code

1. Clone this repository using the`--recurse-submodules` option which will also clone my extended version of the flower submodule at github.com/VasundharaAgarwal/flower.`
2. Ignore the requirements.txt file. Use the pyproject.toml file for installing dependencies by doing `poetry install`
3. Switch into the virtualenv with the dependencies by doing `poetry shell`.
4. Run the main.py script. :)
