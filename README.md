# Instructions for Running Code

1. Clone this repository. The `--recurse-submodules` will also clone the flower submodule at github.`com/VasundharaAgarwal/flower.`

```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/VasundharaAgarwal/diss-fl.git```

2. Ignore the requirements.txt file. Use the pyproject.toml file for installing dependencies by doing `poetry install`
3. Switch into the virtualenv with the dependencies by doing `poetry shell`.
4. Run the main.py script. :)
